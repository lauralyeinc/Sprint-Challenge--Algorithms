#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity is O(n). The while loop is running n times because n is ran only once in the while loop. The a is given an already saved element value of n. 


b)The runtime complexity is O(n^2). The code goes through the first iteration. Then has to run a while loop, making it the second process of it running n.


c) The runtime complexity is 0(n). It runs as many times as what bunnies equal to.

## Exercise II

Find the midpoint of the floors. Check to see if the egg breaks on the midpoint floor, if not split the floors in half and do the same thing again. If the eggs breaks, pass in minimum and midpoint. If the egg doesn't break pass in the maximim and midpoint.
Keep going thru and checking the middle(midpoint) of the pass in arguments. Once the two arguments are the same number, return it as f. Binary Search, the rumtime complexity is O(log n)
